        "query": "derivative of sinx",
        "answer": "The derivative of sin x is the rate of change with respect to angle ie, x. The resultant of the derivative of sin x is cos x. Here also we are going to prove the derivative of sin x to be -cos x using the first principle. The derivative of sin x is cos x. Thus, we have proved that the derivative of sin x is cos x. Therefore, the derivative of sin is cos x and is proved by using the quotient rule. Derivative of Sin x Worksheet Therefore, the derivative of sin x is cos x. * The derivative of sin x is cos x. Thus, the derivative of sin 3x is 3 cos 3x. Therefore, the derivative of sin x by first principle is cos x. We know that the derivative of sin x is cos x. So the derivative of sin x2 using this and using the chain rule is cos x2\u00b7 d/dx(x2). The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). Why? The derivative of any given function is simply the slope of the tangent line to original function ## Derivative of sin x using the First Principle Method f\u2019(x) = limh\u21920 [sin x cos h + cos x sin h \u2013 sin x]/h f\u2019(x) = limh\u21920 [-sin x(1-cosh) + cos x sin h]/h sin (0/2)) + cos x (1) f\u2019(x) = \u2013 sin x(0) + cos x Thus, the derivative of sin x is cos x, is derived. ### Derivative of Sin x Examples Now, we have to find the derivative of sin (x+1), using the 1st principle. Hence, the derivative of sin (x+1), with respect to x is cos (x+1). Find the derivative of sin 2x. **To find:** derivative of sin 2x. Hence, the derivative of sin 2x is 2 cos 2x. : r/calculus : r/calculus Image 1: r/calculus icon Go to calculus r/calculus Image 3: r/calculus iconr/calculus Welcome to r/calculus - a space for learning calculus and related disciplines.
